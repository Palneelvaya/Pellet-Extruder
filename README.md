# Pellet Extruder
## 1. Project Overview
### 1.1 Project Name
> *Pellet extruder integration into Volterra*

### 1.2 Description
> *Install an outsourced pellet extruder into the Volterra 400 3D printer by integrating the electronics and optimizing mechatronics.*

### 1.3 Goals & Objectives
- *Installing the pellet extruder*
- *Autobed Levelling*
- *Mechatronics Restoration*
- Print usable samples through pellet extruder after installing it on volterra


### 1.4 Key Features
- *Outline the main functionalities and design goals.*

---

## 2. Requirements
### 2.1 Hardware Requirements
- *List required components, specifications, and dependencies.*

### 2.2 Software & Tools
- *Mention any software, programming languages, or design tools needed.*

### 2.3 Constraints & Challenges
- *Document limitations such as cost, size, power consumption, etc.*
- Limited knowledge of electronics inside printer
- Refurbishing the machine, removing old parts and integrating old chassis with new design
- More noise and vibration during operation than traditional filament based machines.
- Requires higher temperature to melt pellets
